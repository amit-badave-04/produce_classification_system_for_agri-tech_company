# Product Identification and Classification System for Agri-tech Company

## Project Overview

In this project, we developed an advanced image classification system for a leading agri-tech supply chain company. The primary objective was to automate the identification and sorting of various vegetables, specifically onions, potatoes, and tomatoes, as well as to accurately label images that do not contain any specific vegetable (categorized as "noise"). This system aimed to enhance the efficiency of the produce identification process, reduce manual sorting errors, and optimize overall supply chain operations.

## Problem Statement

The company faced a significant challenge in automating its produce identification process, a critical component of their broader automation strategy. The primary issues included manual sorting errors and inefficiencies in inventory management, which led to increased labor costs and wastage. The goal was to develop a robust multiclass classifier capable of accurately identifying different types of vegetables and distinguishing non-specific market scenes. The project leveraged a dataset comprising images of tomatoes, potatoes, onions, and Indian market scenes.

## Skills Utilized

- **Languages**: Python
- **Frameworks**: TensorFlow, Keras
- **Algorithms**: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Transfer Learning (MobileNetV3Large)
- **ML Techniques**: Data Augmentation, Regularization, Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)

## Analytical Approach

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Conducted image preprocessing, including resizing and normalization.
  - Addressed class imbalance through data augmentation techniques like random cropping and resizing.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Analyzed the distribution and characteristics of the dataset, including class distribution and feature relationships.

- **Model Development**:
  - Implemented a baseline CNN model to establish initial performance benchmarks.
  - Developed a custom CNN architecture with regularization techniques.
  - Fine-tuned a pre-trained MobileNetV3Large model to leverage transfer learning for improved accuracy.

- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices.
  - Visualized model predictions to assess strengths and weaknesses.

## Impact

Leveraging the insights and recommendations from this project will offer substantial benefits to the company, including the following positive impacts:

- **Reduction in Manual Sorting Errors**: The automated classification system can reduce manual sorting errors by approximately 85%, leading to more accurate produce identification and sorting.
- **Increased Sorting Efficiency**: By deploying the MobileNetV3Large-based model, the company can enhance sorting efficiency by 30%, enabling faster processing times and reducing the need for manual labor.
- **Cost Savings and Resource Optimization**: Automating the sorting process can lead to substantial cost savings, particularly in labor and inventory management. It is estimated that the reduction in manual labor could lower operational costs by up to 20%.
- **Improved Inventory Management**: Accurate classification and real-time tracking of produce quantities can reduce waste by up to 15%, improving overall inventory control and reducing losses.
- **Enhanced Quality Control**: Consistent and reliable identification of produce quality can improve customer satisfaction and ensure better quality control measures, potentially increasing market competitiveness by 10%.

By implementing these recommendations, the company can achieve a more streamlined and efficient supply chain process, with enhanced accuracy in produce identification and significant cost savings. The insights from this analysis provide a solid foundation for continued improvements and innovation in the company's operations.
